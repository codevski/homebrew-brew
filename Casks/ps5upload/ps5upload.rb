  caveats <<~EOS
    #{token} is not signed or notarized, so macOS will block it on first launch.
    To allow it, either:
      - open it once, then go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and
        click "Open Anyway" (right-click > Open no longer works on macOS 15+), or
      - run:
          xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/PS5Upload.app"
